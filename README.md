# froSTspin
A Symmetric Tensor library for lattice spin systems at finite temperature.

## Symmetries
froSTspin incorporates both abelian and non-abelian symmetries. It features a unified interface to interact with a SymmetricTensor, irrespective of the specific symmetry group ruling it.

Currently, froSTspin supports the following symmetry groups:
- Z<sub>2</sub>
- U(1)
- O(2)
- SU(2)

## Algorithms
froSTspin includes the following tensor network algorithms:
- simple update
- CTMRG

## Dependencies
- python >= 3.10
- numpy >= 1.23
- scipy >= 1.10
- numba >= 0.57

## Install
The simplest is to git clone this repository and to add it to your PYTHONPATH.

## Usage
